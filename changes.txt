2.0.9
* Changed: Force(s) GUI and attributes
* Added: Example Magnet scene
* Improved: updateConstraints()
* Added: "Static" parameter to btBuild RBDs tab
* Added: "Update every frame" parameter to btBuild RBDs tab
* Added: auto-update mass of compound object from child(s) mass
* Added: Example Voronoi compound(cluster) scene
* Added: New node "btExtraCells" which optimalize creating high&low poly pieces
* Fixed: Problem when Houdini cook SOP_Loader node more than once on same frame
* Fixed: Crash when Constraint includes "index of object" which doesn't exist
* Added: "Ground Plane" option(animated) on btSolver Node
* Changed: Rename "Geometry" => "Shapes"
* Changed: Rename "Properties" => "Physics Properties"
* Added: Emitting system


2.0.10
* Added: Icons
* Fixed: UI range of parameters
* Changed: btTransform -> "Output" options from(Prefer High, High, Low, Both) to (Prefer Original, Original, Collision, Both)
* Changed: btPrepare -> Decomposition::Tetra::"Number of ray steps" -> "Precision" - higher value means accurate(slower)
* Fixed: Problem with btSolver::Output::Zero which didn't work
* Fixed: btTransform "Delete without objs properties" with zero input_1
* Added: Constraint recreate option
* Added: Constraint Reset Equilibrium option
* Fixed: Static Compound
* Added: btTransform "Missing Velocity attribute" error message
* Fixed: Situation when btSolver doesn't delete constraint(s) in bullet world
* Fixed: Moving with static objects which have'nt zero init rotation(bt_cog_r attribute)
* Fixed: Cases when you hit "ESC" key for interuption and Houdini won't update graph
* Added: Balloons scene
* Added: House Destruction scene
* Added: Running on Bullet Library v2.82
* Added: btMLCPSolver constraint solver(slower, but more stable results)


2.0.11
* Fixed: Generating constraints algorithm creates constraint between objects with same compound(parent) object
* Fixed: btPrepare generates tetra form polygon which area is less than 0.001
* Added: Object "Recreate" option which reupdate object(shape+properties) to solver
* Fixed: Smooth static object recreate transformation
* Added: btSolver "Share Shapes" option for Boxes/Spheres - saving memory
* Improved: Source code has cleaner code(std::vector => MyVec, ...)
* Improved: Faster Forces uploading


2.0.12
* Added: Blending algorithm for smooth collision with animated convex bodies
* Fixed: btBuild crash when "copy primitive attributes" was check
* Added: Blending algorithm for smooth collision with animated deform bodies
* Changed: You need to activate "recreate" properties for Deform bodies otherwise plugin doesn't send new vertex positions to solver!


2.0.13
* Fixed: Removing item from vector
